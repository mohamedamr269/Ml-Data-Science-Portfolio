# ðŸ“° Fake News Detection System

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
The **Fake News Detection System** is an end-to-end Machine Learning project designed to identify and classify news articles as *real* or *fake*.  
It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze textual content and uses machine learning models to detect deceptive information patterns.  
This project aims to combat misinformation and enhance trust in digital media platforms.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Detect fake or misleading news using machine learning algorithms.  
- Preprocess and clean text data for better model accuracy.  
- Compare performance of multiple models (Logistic Regression, NaÃ¯ve Bayes, etc.).  
- Visualize insights about the dataset such as word frequencies and sentiment trends.
