# 🚗 Car Price Prediction Model

A **machine learning project** that predicts the price of used cars based on various features such as **make, model, year, mileage, and condition**.  
The project focuses on building a reliable model that helps users or dealers estimate a car’s market value using data-driven insights.

## 📘 Project Overview

The **Car Price Prediction Model** aims to develop a predictive system that estimates the price of a used car based on its characteristics.  
The workflow involves:

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning** – Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Understanding distributions, correlations, and trends.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Creating and transforming features (e.g., encoding categorical variables, handling outliers).  
4. **Model Training** – Comparing multiple regression algorithms:
   - Linear Regression  
   - Random Forest Regressor  
   - XGBoost Regressor  
5. **Model Evaluation** – Using metrics like **R² Score**, **MAE**, and **RMSE**.  
6. **Feature Importance Analysis** – Identifying the most impactful features affecting car prices.
