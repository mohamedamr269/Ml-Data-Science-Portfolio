# ðŸš¦ City Traffic Accident Analysis

A comprehensive **data analysis and visualization project** focused on understanding the patterns, causes, and contributing factors of city traffic accidents.  
The goal of this project is to derive **data-driven insights** to help improve urban road safety, identify high-risk areas, and recommend preventive measures.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of city traffic accidents to uncover correlations between accidents and various factors such as:

- Time of day and day of the week  
- Weather and road conditions  
- Vehicle type and driver demographics  
- Accident severity and location hotspots  

The analysis provides valuable insights for **city planners, traffic departments, and policy makers** aiming to reduce traffic incidents and improve road safety.

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent entries  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Detailed exploration of trends, distributions, and correlations  
- **Feature Engineering**: Categorization of accident severity, weather, and road types  
- **Visualization Dashboards**: Interactive plots showing accident frequency, time trends, and location heatmaps  
- **Predictive Modeling (Optional)**: Machine learning models to predict accident severity

## ðŸ“ˆ Insights & Outcomes

- Peak accident times were identified during **rush hours (7â€“9 AM and 5â€“7 PM)**  
- **Rainy and foggy conditions** significantly increased accident severity  
- Certain **intersections and road segments** were identified as high-risk zones  
- Correlation analysis highlighted the **impact of speeding and weather** on crash likelihood

## ðŸ§® Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection** â€“ Import the dataset (`city_accidents.csv`)  
2. **Data Cleaning** â€“ Handle nulls, remove duplicates, and format columns  
3. **Feature Engineering** â€“ Create new attributes (e.g., time-of-day, severity labels)  
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis** â€“ Visualize key trends and relationships  
5. **Modeling (optional)** â€“ Apply regression/classification models for severity prediction  
6. **Visualization Dashboard** â€“ Generate plots for reports or integration with dashboards
