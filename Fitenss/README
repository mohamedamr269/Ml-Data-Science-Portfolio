## ⚙️ Tasks Completed
- **Data preprocessing and cleaning** to handle missing values and correct column formats.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns and relationships between health features and fitness level.  
- **Applied Machine Learning models** including:  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Trees  
  - Random Forests  
- **Model evaluation** using performance metrics (Accuracy, Recall, F1-Score).  
- **Built an interactive Streamlit app** where users can input their data and get predictions instantly.
