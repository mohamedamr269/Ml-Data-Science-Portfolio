# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis Dashboard

An **end-to-end data science project** designed to analyze and predict student academic performance using machine learning and data visualization.  
The system leverages **Python** for data analysis and model building, and **Power BI** for creating an interactive dashboard that helps educators identify at-risk students and optimize teaching strategies.

## 📘 Project Overview

The **Student Performance Analysis Dashboard** aims to uncover patterns and insights within academic datasets to understand what factors most influence student outcomes.  
By combining data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling, the project provides a holistic view of student performance.

The project includes:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation** – Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing data.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identifying relationships between demographics, study habits, and academic results.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Creating new features such as attendance rate, parental education level, and study time categories.  
4. **Model Development** – Building grade prediction models using **Scikit-learn** (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest).  
5. **Visualization Dashboard** – Designing an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to visualize trends, correlations, and model insights.
